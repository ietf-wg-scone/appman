So it will help to explicitly clarify here that SCONE is not meant for transient congestion control  (due to varying load and/or varying channel conditions) of the bottleneck link (such as air interface or any other bottleneck link).  Both the mechanisms i.e SCONE and L4S are intended to address different scenario/use-case in the network. And if needed, both can co-exist in the network as they complement each other.",
