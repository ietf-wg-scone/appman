1.  Introduction

   The SCONE protocol [I-D.ietf-scone-protocol] provides a signaling
   mechanism that enables on-path SCONE-capable Network Elements to
   communicate the advisory maximum allowable bit rate to application
   endpoints, which is particularly relevant for adaptive bit-rate
   applications.  This document addresses the Applicability and
   Manageability considerations for deploying the SCONE protocol within
   telecommunications service provider networks.

   SCONE operates based on a UDP 4-tuple.  Network Elements capable of
   rate limiting at this granularity can send notifications of the
   advisory maximum allowable bit rate in each direction of the observed
   traffic.  Such Network Elements may also drop or delay packets within
   the corresponding UDP 4-tuple flows.  This implies that on-path
   SCONE-capable Network Elements (referred to as SCONE Network Elements
   in the rest of this document) are assumed to have the following
   capabilities: detect and maintain UDP 4-tuple flows, be aware of or
   configurable with rate-limiting policies, and identify flows that
   carry SCONE packets in order to insert throughput advice into those
   packets.

   In this document, on-path SCONE Network Elements are generally
   considered within the _access_ portion of the Telecommunications
   provider's network.  However, multiple SCONE Network Elements may
   exist along a path between the communicating peers.  Depending on
   their configuration and roles they are likely to generate different
   throughput advices for the SCONE enabled application traffic flows,
   especially when different _access_ technologies are in use.  For
   example, the SCONE protocol in a wireless access network element may
   operate differently from one in a fixed broadband network.  Wi-Fi
   networks provide another example, where enforcement is often per user
   or per Service Set Identifier (SSID), but visibility into individual
   UDP 4-tuples may be limited.  Among access networks, mobile networks
   offer the most fine-grained visibility into traffic flows and can act
   on individual flows.  For example, in mobile networks, the User Plane
   Function (UPF) in 5G [_5G-Arch] and the Packet Data Network Gateway
   (P-GW) in 4G [_4G-Arch] can generate throughput advice to guide
   adaptive bit-rates applications on a per-flow basis.  In contrast,
   wireline broadband networks typically apply rate limiting at a
   centralized Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) or at aggregation points
   serving multiple Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices.

   Accordingly, Applicability and Manageability considerations must
   encompass a wide range of access-network scenarios, each of which
   handles per-flow rate limiting differently.  However, the scope of
   this document is limited to discussing the core Applicability and
   Manageability considerations for the SCONE protocol.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   This document uses terms and definitions described in
   [I-D.ietf-scone-protocol].

3.  Applicability and Manageability Considerations

3.1.  Flow session awareness

   SCONE signaling operates only over established sessions.  SCONE
   Network Elements ought to be able to unambiguously associate
   throughput advice with application flows.  Each session is bound to
   an IP address and port, ensuring SCONE packets are routed precisely
   without affecting unrelated traffic.

3.2.  Per-Flow Signaling

   Throughput advice is applied on a UDP 4-tuple basis.  SCONE Network
   Elements ought to maintain flow-specific context to ensure signaling
   correctness.  This enables applications to receive targeted
   throughput advice while preventing unintended impact on unrelated
   flows.

3.3.  QoS awareness

   Quality of Service (QoS) may be enforced by networks through a
   variety of mechanisms.  In certain deployments, network operators may
   choose to apply distinct QoS policies to SCONE-enabled flows.  The
   SCONE Network Element responsible for inserting SCONE advice is not
   required to interpret or enforce QoS policies; its role is limited to
   the signaling of the advisory throughput information.  It is expected
   that network operators shall be able to identify SCONE-enabled flows
   and, where appropriate, provide throughput advice in accordance to
   their policy objectives.

3.4.  SCONE Hint to the Network

   SCONE-aware applications ought to provide hints to the SCONE Network
   Elements, enabling it to generate appropriate throughput advice for a
   given UDP 4-tuple.  Such hints prevent unnecessary default rate-
   limiting, allow the network to signal the maximum allowable bit rate,
   and reduce CPU overhead by eliminating additional classification
   steps.

3.5.  Retransmission of Advised Bit-Rate

   Packet loss or non-delivery of SCONE advice reduces its
   effectiveness.  Both SCONE Network Elements and application endpoints
   should support retransmission or periodic re-sending of SCONE packets
   to ensure reliable delivery.  Conformance depends on the behavior of
   both network and application endpoint.

3.6.  Frequency of Updates

   The rate at which SCONE updates are issued depends on flow
   characteristics and available computational resources.  Excessively
   frequent updates may increase CPU load, while infrequent updates may
   reduce advisory effectiveness.  Network Operators can define
   adjustable update intervals based on application requirements,
   network capacity, and operational constraints.

3.7.  Dynamic Updates

   Dynamic rate limits updates can be enforced by the network during
   active application sessions due to:

   *  Changes in access network type (requiring updated throughput
      advice)

   *  Changes in Subscriber policy (e.g., exceeding usage thresholds)

   In such cases, the SCONE Network Elements need to be able to initiate
   SCONE packets to provide updated advice, or applications should
   generate SCONE packets frequently enough to trigger network
   responses.

3.8.  Monitoring and Logging

   SCONE signaling can be integrated into existing operational and
   management frameworks to enable monitoring, troubleshooting, and
   fault isolation.  Metrics of interest include:

   *  Rate of SCONE advisory messages issued per session

   *  Correlation between SCONE advisories and user-plane throughput
      changes

   *  Error conditions where SCONE signaling fails to reach the intended
      endpoints

3.9.  Conformance Monitoring

   Networks providing SCONE throughput advice ought to implement
   mechanisms to measure compliance, either per application flow or in
   aggregate.  This allows operators to validate advisory effectiveness
   and adjust policies.  Due to flow awareness, such mechanisms are
   typically implemented in a SCONE Network Element but may also be
   implemented elsewhere in the network.

3.10.  Standards Compliance

   SCONE signaling is expected to traverse the existing data path
   associated with the UDP 4-tuple flow for which the Network Element
   intends to send the advisory bit-rate.

3.11.  Interworking with Other Congestion Management Mechanisms

   SCONE operates independently of transport-layer mechanisms such as
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) or Low Latency, Low Loss, and
   Scalable throughput (L4S).  Operators would benefit from harmonizing
   multiple congestion signaling methods by policy or scope deployments
   to manage conflicting feedback.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are included separately in the SCONE protocol
   documents.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
